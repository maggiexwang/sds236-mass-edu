# Boston Public High School Dropout Rates

Exploring Boston public high school dropout rates, as part of a short writing assignment for Data Journalism (Smith College, Spring 2018).
Repository created to document the data manipulation process behind the reporting.

## Findings
Nearly 10% of the 17,000 students who attended public and charter high schools in Boston dropped out in 2017. The pattern can be partially explained by the high percentages of high-need and minority students in public high schools.
Compared Boston public school data to Massachusetts state-wide data and with private school data.
